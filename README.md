# WiiNunchuck
Python code to read data from the Wii Nunchuk.
I have taken the code from Boeeerb[https://github.com/Boeeerb] project Nunchuck/
[https://github.com/Boeeerb/Nunchuck/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi/], and adapted it to read data from the Wii Nunchuck with no encryption. Robert Eisele[https://github.com/infusion] has provided the project Fritzing/Nunchuk/[https://github.com/infusion/Fritzing/tree/master/Nunchuk] and documentation [https://www.xarg.org/2016/12/using-a-wii-nunchuk-with-arduino/].

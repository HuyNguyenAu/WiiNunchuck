# WiiNunchuck Eletric Skateboard
Python code to read data from the Wii Nunchuk.
I have taken the code from [Boeeerb](https://github.com/Boeeerb) project [Nunchuck](https://github.com/Boeeerb/Nunchuck/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi/), and adapted it to read data from the Wii Nunchuck with no encryption. [Robert Eisele]( https://github.com/infusion) project [Fritzing/Nunchuk](https://github.com/infusion/Fritzing/tree/master/Nunchuk) and [documentation](https://www.xarg.org/2016/12/using-a-wii-nunchuk-with-arduino/), provides the method to reading the Wii Nunchuck with no encryption.
